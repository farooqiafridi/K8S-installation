A solution that does not involve editing systemd units or drop-ins would be to create (or edit) the /etc/docker/daemon.json configuration file and to include the following:

{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}

sed -i "s/cgroupDriver: systemd/cgroupDriver: cgroupfs/g" /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet
